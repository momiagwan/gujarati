    Ghanchi is a caste found in state of Gujarat and Rajasthan.The Ghanchi name means "oil pressers" , "oil traders" and "merchants of oil", which is their traditional work in the past but by the passage of time they get involved in other businesses related to industries. It represents our community mainly as “SAHU” which means merchants. Mostly Ghanchis  converted to Islam on the hand of Kadpeer ShahGora(R.A) but also some clans such as Sayyid and others were muslim immigrants to join the Ghanchi caste.Ghanchis are spreaded through out the Gujarat State .They belong to Region of sorath(kathiyawar),jhalawar,halar,Gohilwar and Kutch.Ghanchis migrated to cities which were business hub i.e Mumbai and Karachi in the era of 1850s.Firstly Halai and Kutchi Ghanchi jamats migrated to Karachi and Sorathia migrated to Mumbai then after 1947 many Ghanchis migrated to karachi and formed their jamats there as other Gujarati muslims.There are many Jamats of Ghanchis in karachi out of which 13 jamats together formed federation called "All Muslim Ghanchi Federation"

  <p className='mt-3 text-lg  text-neutral-500 max-w-4xl'>People from Sorathia Ghanchi community are mainly belong to cities like Ahmedabad, Amreli, Bagasra, Bilkha, Bhavnagar, Damnagar, Junagadh, Kalol, Baroda, and many other Parts of Gujarat.The year 1947 holds a very dear and special place in our hearts because this is the year we remember as when our ancestors first migrated from Kathiyawad (Saurashtra) in Gujarat to Karachi , the city of dreams as it is popular known the world over. The migration that started with just few families in pursuit of better livelihood, bigger opportunities and prosperous life set a trend in our Kathiyawad and hundreds and thousands of people have followed them and come to Karachi since then. All of us, including our ancestors are so full of gratitude for Karachi  and the people of Karachi, which lovingly welcomed us with open arms and plethora of opportunities for our progress.Then Sorathia muslim Ghanchi jamat was formed in 1947 in karachi and areas of Agra taj colony,Lyari,Pib colony,Gulberg town,Soldier bazaar and shah Fiasal town became centers of sorathia community with firstly Agra taj then Pib colony as their community center.A place for jamatKhana was bought for community office, wedding and important events. Community consists of 42 clans in which Agwan Bilaikhiya,Parmar,Deraiya,Malaviya and Shekhda are well-known.They adopt the system of democracy to choose their community president and formed small committees of Education ,hospital ,Death,Event handling,Money-management and Elderly members council(Buzurg commitee for handling disputes and rules-maintenance). </p>
